4. Research & Work Experience
Research Intern | Laboratory of Statistical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning


Location: Palakkad, Kerala 


Duration: May 2025 – July 2025 


Focus: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) and Hybrid Training. 

Key Achievements:

Collaborated on a hybrid training method for PCs that is more generalizable than EM and faster than SGD. 

Implemented a Hessian-based regularizer to reduce overfitting by guiding models toward flatter optima. 

Proved that Hessian trace (sharpness proxy) is efficiently computable for PCs, enabling closed-form updates. 

Utilized HPC infrastructure to train neural networks and validate methods across multiple benchmarks. 


Outcome: Co-authored the paper "Tractable Sharpness-Aware Learning of Probabilistic Circuits," accepted for Oral Presentation at AAAI-26 (Singapore). 

Part-time Research Intern | Laboratory of Statistical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning


Location: Palakkad, Kerala 


Duration: May 2024 – April 2025 


Focus: Optimization of Bosch's SMT assembly line (32 PCB types, 200+ components). 

Key Achievements:

Developed an algorithm for optimal feeder arrangements, improving pick-and-place efficiency. 

Increased components-per-hour (CPH) by at least 7% while meeting manufacturing constraints. 

Utilized Genetic Algorithms, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), and Nonlinear Programming. 


Outcome: Patent filed due to the novelty of the approach.
